The only way this works is if [NAME] is doing the Bird Box challenge and cant see the terms of the contract.,0
I've never seen anyone in a political discussion admit to being Russian though. [NAME] has made no secret that she is Canadian.,0

"Yeah, but I just don't want to pay for a full blown wedding, those can get expensive.",1
The general rule is that [NAME] is talking rubbish whenever he opens his mouth.,2
Let's be honest here if [NAME] played last night the Canucks win. This defense is a major concern and needs a complete overhaul this offseason.,1
This was amazing,1
I just don't like our options in the off season.,2

I think it's weird that he didn't just wake you up and weirder that he didn't tell you until you noticed it was missing.,2
His Fairy Godparents are just a hallucination created by his mind as a coping mechanism to deal with the hostile world around him.,0

Your personality comes off as really obnoxious and overbearing. Maybe your thinly-veiled desperation explains why she didn‚Äôt want to go out with you.,0
"I'm 100% sure you were punched in the face, but this was a good one",1

Thank goodness.,1
"""...but then some guy on internet promised, yes promised, that [NAME] existed, and it turned my life around"". Dude, come on...",0
Sadly I don't think even half the people who watched the game are gonna hear about that.,2
And that is what cognitive dissonance looks like. People do the craziest things when reality doesn't meet their expectations.,1
I cringe every time [NAME] is in a fast break because it usually ends with his shot getting spiked lol.,1
"Yay, another second tier free agent over 30. Thank God we're making a market for these players. Go Mets!",1

Lol. My gamer tag is the same as on here if you ever want to squad up and play man,1

Two problems: It's not a newsworthy story. You'd get sued for defamation.,2
Thanks for the laugh lol,1
Don't be angry. Encountering toxic people in online games is common and you won't change that. Try playing single-player or games with more sophisticated community,1
